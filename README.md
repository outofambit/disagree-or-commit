disagree(?) or commit(?)

i often feel like my nervous system is too entrenched in corporate software culture. this project is an exercise in "deprogramming" my own nervous system by weakening or confusing word associations.

"disagree and commit" is a phrase commonly used in the software industry to describe a culture of agreeing to support whatever the company (executives) or team (manager, team lead, project owner) decides after discussing options even if you disagree with the option ultimately selected.
